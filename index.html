              Everyday digital interfaces include a rich variety of images,
              visualizations, and other pictures. However, more than anything else,
              they are made of words. Oh so many words. As we equip teams to design
              and code usable, consistent, beautiful interfaces using systems, it's
              essential that words depend on a strong foundation of typography.

              I'll admit, I am not a typography expert. I lack a graphic design
              degree. I'm never the person choosing a font, scaling type, or
              finessing letter spacing. As a result, I've always been reluctant to
              write about typography.

              On the other hand, I am a pattern hunter. Over the years, I've
              contributed to many design systems that set a foundation for
              typography. Each traversed of steps and decisions to set a foundation
              and apply it to an emerging library of interface components. This
              article summarizes those patterns.

              Typography starts by setting a foundation of font families and weights
              along with fallbacks. It then explores how to build hierarchy using
              size, color, additional details like line-height, and layering
              responsiveness. Those models are then applied to components in a
              system's library (like Article and Header) as well as custom
              components made by other teams.
